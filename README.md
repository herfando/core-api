Core API

A centralized, production-style RESTful backend service designed to power multiple independent frontend applications from a single scalable platform.

This API supports a full portfolio ecosystem including:

Ecommerce applications

Restaurant ordering systems

Movie database platforms

Digital library systems

Social media applications

Personal portfolio services

Built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, following real-world backend architecture and scalable system design principles.

🚀 Purpose

Core API provides a unified backend platform where multiple client applications share authentication, database structures, and reusable domain logic.

By consolidating backend services into a single modular architecture, it enables:

Secure user authentication and account management

Generic catalog and content management system

Reviews, ratings, and feedback handling

Orders and transaction management

Social media content management

User avatars and media uploads

This approach reflects industry-standard backend design for multi-application support.
